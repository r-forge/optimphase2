_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Find the sample size, duration of accrual, and test boundary for a
     single-stage design with time to event endpoint versus a known
     control standard. Testing is one-sided based on the Kaplan-Meier
     estimator at a user-specified time point.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     FixDes(B.init, m.init, alpha, beta, param, x)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  B.init: A vector of user-specified time points (B1, ..., Bb) that
          determine a set of time intervals with uniform accrual.

  m.init: The projected number of patients that can be accrued within
          the time intervals determined by 'B.init'.

   alpha: Type I error.

    beta: Type II error.

   param: A four-element vector containing: the shape parameter of the
          Weibull distribution under the null hypothesis, the scale
          parameter of the Weibull distribution under the null
          hypothesis, the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution
          under the alternative hypothesis, the scale parameter of the
          Weibull distribution under the alternative hypothesis.

       x: Survival time of interest (e.g., 1 year).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Estimation is based on the Kaplan-Meier or Nelson-Aalen estimators
     evaluated at a target time (e.g., 1 year).  The event rates at the
     target time are computed from Weibull distributions assumed for
     the treated and (assumed known) control distributions, as is done
     in function 'OptimDes'. The design depends only on the event rates
     at the target time (except for small changes due to rounding with
     different survivor functions). The duration of accrual depends on
     the projected maximum accrual rates.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with components: 

      n0: Fixed design sample size

      DA: Duration of accrual

      SL: Total study length ('time, DA+x').

     n0E: n0 based on exact binomial test

     DAE: DA based on exact binomial test

     SLE: SL based on exact binomial test

       C: Rejection cutpoint for the test statistic.

_N_o_t_e:

     The single-stage sample size is used as the starting value for
     evaluating the optimal 'n' for a two-stage design in 'OptimDes'.
