_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Construct a two-stage design  for a time to event endpoint with
     possible stopping for futility after the end of Stage 1.  The
     design  minimizes either the expected duration of accrual (EDA) or
     the expected total study length (ETSL).  The combined sample size
     for both stages is pre-specifed by the user.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     np.OptimDes(
                 B.init, m.init, alpha, beta, param, x, n = NULL, pn = NULL,
                pt = NULL, target = c("EDA", "ETSL"), recover=TRUE,
                control = OptimDesControl(), CMadj=F, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  B.init: A vector of user-specified time points (B1, ..., Bb) that
          determine a set of time intervals with uniform accrual.

  m.init: The projected number of patients that can be accrued within
          the time intervals determined by 'B.init'.

   alpha: Type I error.

    beta: Type II error.

   param: A four-element vector containing: the shape parameter of the
          Weibull distribution under the null hypothesis, the scale
          parameter of the Weibull distribution under the null
          hypothesis, the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution
          under the alternative hypothesis, the scale parameter of the
          Weibull distribution under the alternative hypothesis.

       x: Survival time of interest (e.g., 1 year).

       n: User-specified combined sample size for both stages. 

      pn: Combined sample size for both stages specified by the ratio
          of the targetted two-stage sample size to the correponding
          sample size for a single-stage design.

      pt: Combined sample size for both stages specified by the ratio
          of the targetted two-stage study length to the correponding
          study length for a single-stage design.

  target: When the expected duration of accrual (EDA) is to be
          minimized, 'target="EDA"'. When the expected total study
          length is to be minimized, 'target="ETSL"'.

 recover: The Simon Two-Stage design recovers alpha from the Type I
          errors that would have occured if the study had not been
          stopped early for futility.  This recovery allows for a
          slightly lower boundary for the final test, thereby
          increasing power.  The default with partial data at the
          interim analysis is to recover the alpha as with the standard
          Simon design.  When recover=F, the optimal design is found
          assuming that the boundary for the final test will not be
          adjusted downward ignoring this small potential gain to
          ensure protection of the alpha level even when the accrual
          rates and survivor functions are mis-specified.  

 control: An optional list of control settings.  See 'OptimDesControl'
          for the parameters that can be set and their default values.

   CMadj: If CMadj=T, the ratios in 'pn' and 'pt' use the exact
          binomial sample size in the denominator. The 'CMadj' has no
          effect when 'n' is specified.  The default is 'CMadj=F'.

     ...: No additional optional parameters are currently implemented

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Plots ('plot.OptimDes') based on the ouput of 'OptimDes' can be
     used to find compromise designs based on different combined sample
     sizes (stages 1 and 2) with near optimal values for both ETSL and
     EDA.  'np.OptimDes' can be used to compute ETSL, EDA, and the
     other design parameters for any specified total sample size.

     The targetted combined sample size must be specified by one of
     three equivalent approaches: 'n', 'pn', and 'pt'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list of class 'OptimDes' with the same output as function
     'OptimDes'.
