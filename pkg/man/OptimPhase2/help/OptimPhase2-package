     'OptimDes' is the primary function in package 'OptimPhase2'. 
     Detailed documentation of the design is in method.pdf, which can
     be found under "directory" on the package HTML help page.  The
     user supplies the projected accrual distribution and distributions
     for time to event under the null and alternative hypotheses. 
     'OptimDes' returns the total sample size, the interim time and
     sample size, and boundaries for decision rules.

     'plot.OptimDes' can be applied to the output of 'OptimDes' to
     evaluate other two-stage designs that may achieve near optimal
     results for both of the implemented optimality criteria.
     'print.OptimDes' produces a summary of the design with a
     comparison to a standard single-stage design (which can also be
     obtained from 'FixDes')  Design parameters for nearly optimal
     designs can be evaluated with 'np.OptimDes'.  Statistical tests
     for a two-stage design are implemented in 'Test2stage'.

     The function 'SimDes' produces simulations under the assumed
     design by default to check the accuracy of asymptotic
     approximations. By supplying alterative accrual and survival
     distributions, the performance of the design and estimation can be
     checked for robustness.

     The function 'weibPmatch' can be used to find parameters of a
     Weibull distribution that match a specified event rate at a
     specified time.  Function 'weibull.plot' displays a
     null-alternative pair of hypothesized Weibull survival functions.
