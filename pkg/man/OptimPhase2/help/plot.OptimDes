_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Output from function 'OptimDes' is used to display the ETSL and
     EDA for a two-stage design relative to a single-stage design as a
     function of the combined stage 1 and 2 sample size.

     ## S3 method for class 'OptimDes':
     plot(x, xscale = "t", l.type = 1:4, l.col =
     c("blue", "green", "red"), CMadj=F, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: Output from function 'OptimDes'.

  xscale: Scale of the x-axis. '"t"' for combined stage 1 and 2 study
          length.  '"n"' for combined sample size. Default is 't'.

  l.type: Line types for the plot. Default is '1-4'.

   l.col: Line colors for the plot. Default is '"blue"' for 'ETSL',
          '"green"' for 'EDA' and '"red"' for 't1'.

   CMadj: If true, the sample sizes and times are adjusted by the ratio
          of the exact binomial to asymptotic normal sample size for
          the single stage design, as in Case and Morgan 2003. 
          Proportional adjustment of times and samplesizes are made
          even if the accrual rates are not constant.  Default is
          false.   

     ...: Additional graphical parameters passed to function 'plot'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The plot displays the tradeoff between ETSL and EDA  as a function
     of the combined sample size.  The robustness of the optimal
     two-stage  design to deviations from the target sample size can be
     explored.  The plots often suggest compromise designs achieving
     near-optimal results for both EDA and ETSL.  Test boundary values
     (C1, C2), and numerical values of other design parameters, can be
     obtained for a design selected from the plots using function
     'np.OptimDes'.

     The plot also includes the time of the interim analysis ('t1') as
     a ratio to the time for a corresonding single-stage analysis.
